## Business Problem Statement

A leading retail company wants to better understand its customers’ shopping behavior in order  
to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The management team has  
noticed changes in purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and sales  
channels (online vs. offline). They are particularly interested in uncovering which factors, such  
as discounts, reviews, seasons, or payment preferences, drive consumer decisions and repeat  
purchases.  
You are tasked with analyzing the company’s consumer behavior dataset to answer the  
following overarching business question:  
“How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve  
customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?”

transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and  
purchase drivers.  
3. Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key  
patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.  
4. Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings  
and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates  
insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.
